Hello there,
In order to test the API endpoints, you need to import the postman collection into postman found 
in the folder named Postman Request.
Inside you'll find one module named User Module and another inside it named Task Module. To test the 
tasks endpoints you need to first register a user then log in with this user, you need to copy the jwt token
generated from the login process and then paste inside the authorization header in each of the tasks CRUD operation.
This is made to gurantee that the user is actually using a JWT token generated by the API.

If you need any further clarification please contact me right away
